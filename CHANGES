Version 0.2 released 08 Feb 2009

* Changed diff to do a line-by-line rather than word-by-word diff.
  The word-by-word diff led to excessive memory usage and confusing
  output in some cases.  NOTE:  diff now returns lists of lines,
  not including newlines.  So calling programs may need to be changed.

  diff also now skips calling getGroupedDiff when the left document
  is empty, for better performance.

* Added ghc-prof-options to cabal file.

* Clean up code in gitRetrieve.

* Added ensureFileExists to Darcs module. Added checks to ensure that file
  exists in darcsLatestRevId and darcsRetrieve.  If not, return
  NotFound.

* gitRetrieve:  check to make sure object is a file before retrieving.
  Also, if Nothing is the revision ID, use gitLatestRevId rather than
  going directly to the file system. This is a step in the direction of
  making filestore compatible with bare repositories.

* Test suite has been wired into Setup.lhs:  'cabal test' now runs tests.

* Added new test case for attempting to retrieve a subdirectory,
  and for creating a second file in a subdirectory.

* Minor code cleanup.

* Added CHANGES.
